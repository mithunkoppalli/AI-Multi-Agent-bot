## 1. Project Title

Open Deep Research – A Multi-Agent AI System for Research-Oriented Question Answering

---

## 2. Project Overview

Open Deep Research is an AI-powered research assistant developed using a multi-agent architecture.
The system is designed to answer user queries by performing structured research, generating reliable responses, and maintaining conversation continuity within a session.

Unlike basic chatbots that provide isolated responses, this system supports context-aware conversations and research-backed answers with transparent sources.

## 3. Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- To design a multi-agent AI system for structured research
- To maintain session memory and conversational continuity
- To allow users to ask follow-up questions without repeating context
- To generate research-based answers using trusted sources

### Architecture Description

- The Streamlit interface handles all user interactions.
- A session memory layer maintains conversation context.
- The Planner Agent analyzes user queries and structures research steps.
- The Searcher Agent retrieves information from trusted academic sources.
- The Writer Agent synthesizes research into a clear final response.
- Chat history is stored locally and can be reused within the session.

---

## 6. Workflow

1. User submits a query through the Streamlit interface.
2. Session memory retrieves previous conversation context.
3. Planner Agent decomposes the query into research tasks.
4. Searcher Agent collects information from research-based sources.
5. Writer Agent generates a structured and readable response.
6. Source URLs are appended to the final answer.
7. Chat history is preserved for follow-up queries.

## 7. Agent Roles

### Planner Agent
- Understands user intent
- Breaks queries into structured research steps

### Searcher Agent
- Retrieves data from academic and trusted sources
- Ensures factual grounding

### Writer Agent
- Synthesizes research content
- Produces human-readable responses

### Agent Pipeline
- Implemented using LangGraph
- Ensures controlled and sequential execution

## 9. Session Memory and Continuity Support

- The system retains user messages within a session.
- Previous interactions are stored temporarily.
- Follow-up questions are answered based on earlier conversation context.
- Users can continue conversations naturally without repeating information.

This ensures a smooth and context-aware conversational experience.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Multi-user authentication
- Database-backed chat storage
- Improved citation formatting
- Enhanced UI and user experience
- Cloud deployment and scalability

---

## 11. Conclusion

Open Deep Research demonstrates the practical implementation of a multi-agent AI system with session memory and research-backed reasoning.
The project highlights modular design, structured research flow, and conversational continuity, making it suitable for intelligent research assistant applications.
